# Melanoma Detection Assignment
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- In this assignment, we are build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 
- To develop a CNN-based model capable of accurately detecting melanoma, a potentially deadly form of cancer if not diagnosed early.
- This model can analyze images and alert dermatologists to the presence of melanoma, helping to significantly reduce the manual effort required for diagnosis.
- The dataset comprises 2,357 images of malignant and benign oncological conditions, obtained from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). The images are classified according to ISIC's guidelines, with most subsets evenly distributed, except for the slightly higher prevalence of melanomas and moles. The dataset is further divided into training and testing sets.
